Personal Website & Portfolio

Data is my passion.
I just realized this passion after entering workforce. Although my bachelor degree is very unrelated (Food Technology), it does not stop me to pursue my passion! Through all of the hardships I endure, who thought now that food technologist can become a data enthusiast?

My Experience
I have 4.5 years of experience as an analyst. Not just doing data analysis, but also understanding system, leading projects, leading team, proposing system innovation, and managing stakeholders. Currently I am working as the Regional Fraud Risk Management in Seamoney Singapore, managing fraud risk team and system in Indonesia & Philippines. 

I believe competency is gained through consistent learning and practice. No skills are gained overnight! So that's why I need to be the best version of me every day to keep improving my competency.

1. Python, R, SQL, Power BI, Excel
2. Certified Data Scientist & Data Analyst

Projects:
[**Boat Listing View Prediction**](https://github.com/garyrustandi/boat-view-prediction) 

**Goal:** predict the number of boat listing views so that we can filter out which boat to be viewed. Furthermore, we also can choose important features to be included in the survey.

Data management includes splitting columns, handling missing data, handling outliers, and removing unnecessary data. The best result is achieved through Random Forest Regression.
